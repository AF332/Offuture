# Descriptive Analytics Project - Offuture

## Project Overview
This project aimed to deliver a proof-of-concept descriptive analytics report for Offuture, a global office and technology supply store. Tasked with analysing sales data from 2011 to 2015, the goal was to rebuild trust in analytics by accurately describing business performance across key metrics. This report served as the foundation for potential future predictive modeling.

### Objectives:
1. **Performance Insights**: Analyse sales and profit trends by year, quarter, and category.
2. **Key Focus Areas**: Identify top and bottom-performing products and investigate specific anomalies, such as the 2013-Q3 performance drop.
3. **Visualisation and Storytelling**: Present findings in a clear, engaging manner using Tableau and SQL queries.

## SQL File Description

### `Team_AIME_SQL_Queries.sql`
This file contains all SQL queries developed to analyze the dataset. The queries include:

#### Performance Analysis
- **Total Sales and Profits**:
  - Calculated yearly, quarterly, and monthly totals.
  - Segmented analysis by product categories, subcategories, and individual products.
- **Category and Subcategory Insights**:
  - Identified top-performing categories (e.g., Technology).
  - Analysed subcategory profitability, such as the dominance of copiers within Technology.
- **Product-Level Analysis**:
  - Ranked best and worst-performing products by profit margins.
  - Explored patterns in sales volume and discounting strategies.
- **Anomaly Investigation**:
  - Focused on the significant profit drop in Q3 2013.
  - Cross-referenced subcategories and identified drivers of poor performance.

#### Supporting Visualisations
- Prepared data for Tableau visualisations to highlight:
  - Trends in sales and profits over time.
  - Performance comparisons across categories and subcategories.
  - Key insights into the impact of discounts on profitability.

## Key Findings
1. **Profitability by Category**:
   - Technology accounted for 45% of total profits, outperforming Office Supplies (35%) and Furniture (20%).
2. **Subcategory Dominance**:
   - Copiers led the Technology subcategory, contributing 39% of its profits.
3. **Yearly Trends**:
   - Consistent growth in sales and profits from 2011 to 2014, except for a notable drop in 2013-Q3.
4. **2013-Q3 Anomaly**:
   - Profitability of phones declined sharply due to heavy discounting, impacting overall quarterly profits.

## Deliverables
1. **SQL Script**:
   - Contains all queries for performance analysis and insights validation.
2. **Tableau Visualisations**:
   - Graphical representation of key findings, trends, and anomalies.
3. **Presentation**:
   - Delivered a comprehensive report summarising insights and recommendations.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the ability to provide accurate and actionable insights through descriptive analytics. By rebuilding trust in data and delivering clear, reliable results, the team established a strong foundation for Offutureâ€™s future analytics initiatives.
